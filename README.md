# Open Linux Hardening Check (OLHC)
Tooling to assist security checks on Linux systems. 

OLHC is a framework with a number of security checks for the Linux operating system. The framework primarily writes to a central "flat file" logging structure. A logstash implementation can be used to do the filtering, interpretation and consoldation of a large number of Linux servers. By using OLHC in combination with Logstash a centralized security logging and reporting solution can eb constructed. 

OLHC is primarily written and tested based upon Oracle Linux.
