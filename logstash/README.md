<b>logstash Example</b>
The logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf file contains a example logstash configuration. The example logstash.conf file is used as the primary logstash configuration during testing of OLHC functionlity. 

The example can be adpoted and enriched with specific filters where needed and appropriate for a specific situation. Changing the logstash.conf file will NOT change any functionality within OLHC, it will only apply on the logstash functionality.
